## Install
Currently there may be some issues with versions of [gumpy](https://github.com/oxfordmmm/gumpy)/[piezo](https://github.com/oxfordmmm/piezo) on pypi, so these may need to be installed from git.
```
git clone git@github.com:GlobalPathogenAnalysisService/gnomon.git
cd gnomon
pip install .
```
